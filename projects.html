                                            During my spare time I've been inspired to use what I have learned at school to create new games, programs, or simply see what I am able to create.
                                            <br>So, here are some of my projects outside of school.

                                                My favorite mini-game in the Board Game "Mansions of Madness" is its "Mastermind".
                                                Unfortunately, it is not guarantied to get it during a game, so I wanted to see if I could make something similar to it for unlimited use.

                                                Due to its lengthy setup, I made a simple program to automate this process.

                                                Since 2017 I have been working on a tabletop game set to the Naruto universe.
                                                Making cards in Photoshop can be tedious.
                                                So, after getting some coding knowledge I built my own card generator for the card types in my game.

                                                I have expended upon what I've learned from making the "Naruto Board Game Card Generator", being able to create more detailed cards.

                                                I tried to make a 2D pixel map generator, making rules for the terrian.

                                                So I wanted to see if I could make an algorithm able to make solvable ones.

                                                Sometimes I get questions on my mind that get stuck.
                                                When driving home from class one day, I got the urge to find out how many times "Harry" was mentioned throughout the Harry Potter Books.
                                                So of course did I make a program to resolve this question, and made it so that any word can be searched and resolved.

                                                Somewhat before christmas my in-laws wanted to make a "Secret Santa" for the christmas eve.
                                                The downside with a normal setup is that the organizer have to know all connections, to be sure no one get themselves as "Secret Santa".
                                                I made a little program to delegate all participants, giving them each a ".txt"-file with thier chosen one.

                                                7 years and 5 versions later, I have made what I consider a fun strategic tabletop game that encapsulates the feel from the series and provides many replayability mechanics.

                                                The surprise during the next cabin trip became the outline for "Social Capital", a card game where the owner build its own deck from scratch.
