                                                One of my favorite features in the Board Game "Mansions of Madness" is its take on the game "Mastermind".
                                                Unfortunately, it is not guarantied to stumble upon it during the game, so I wanted to see if I could make a gaming experiance similar to what's displayed in the Screen-portion of the game.

                                                During social gatherings, such as "Eurovision" and "E3", we often make additional activities, such as a "Bingo".
                                                This often take time to make, so I made a simple program to automate this process with the possibility of making several Bingos and change its word-pool in the future.

                                                So I wanted to see if I could make an algorithm suitable to make solvable Sudokus.

                                                Due to little knowledge, I tried to make a 2D pixel map generator, making rules for water, and, beach and trees to simulate a procedurally generated world.

                                                Since 2017 I have been working on a tabletop game set to the Naruto universe.
                                                Most of my time have been used making cards in Photoshop, but this process can be tedious when text and icons have to be matched for each card and the project file becomes large.
                                                After getting some coding knowledge, I could build my own card generator suitable for the card types in my game.
                                                I have expanded upon this throughout the development process and will never go back to the way I did things revious.

                                                As a fan of the reality TV show "Survivor", I have wanted to make a tabletop game based on it for a long time.
                                                With 500 contestants, over 150 challenges and several attributes as crucial for survival the game, the concept may be good for a tabletop game.
                                                For this card generator I have expended upon what I've learned from making the "Naruto Board Game Card Generator", being able to create more detailed cards.

                                                Sometimes I get questions on my mind that I cannot seem to get rid of.
                                                When driving home from class one day, I got the urge to find out how many times "Harry" was mentioned throughout the seven Harry Potter Books.
                                                So of course did I make a program to resolve this question.
                                                I made it so that any word can be searched and resolved.

                                                Somewhat before christmas my in-laws wanted to make a "Secret Santa" for the christmas eve.
                                                The downside with a normal setup is that the organizer have to know all connections, to be sure no one get themselves as "Secret Santa".
                                                I made a little program to delegate all participants, giving them each a ".txt"-file with thier chosen one.

                                                As a fan of the Naruto series, I wanted to make a tabletop game that were more strategic and went more in-dept into the series than what other Naruto tabletop games have done.
                                                7 years and 5 versions later, I have made what I consider a fun strategic tabletop game that encapsulates the feel from the series and provides a lot of replayability mechanics.

                                                As my biggest hobby is making tabletop games, one of my friends mentions as a joke on a cabin trip that I should make a card game that reflected my friends.
                                                Like "I play your Grandma. You are stuffed by waffles and cannot take your action".
                                                So, of course I did!! (as a surprise during the next cabin trip)
                                                This became the outline for "Social Capital", a card game where the owner build its own deck based on whatever it wants.
                                                All cards starts empty and the owner can choose actions from a manual and make its own art on the card.

                                                I made the design and assigned words that fit the different houses.
                                                This way the game can be played in modes, based on the different houses.
