						<h3 class="major">Programming career</h3>
						<p>
							The first taste I had of coding was back in 2008 when a friend introduced me to the game dev program <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/521880/RPG_Maker_VX/">RPG Maker VX</a>.
							Here, I could build 2D games without having to know any programming language. And I was hooked.
						</p>
						<p>
							7 years later, in 2015, a new version was released (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/363890/RPG_Maker_MV/">RPG Maker MV</a>) which used <i>JavaScript</i> instead of the more inaccessible <i>Ruby</i>.
							Up until then, I had build a 20 hours game trying to expand what was possible to make within the program's limitations.
							Moving into <i>JavaScript</i> made the code more accessable and the plugin community increased rapidly.
							I found it interesting trying to change plugins to better fit my world, and so I became properly introduced to programming.

							During my 3rd year in high school I attended IT-classes, which taught me the basics in HTML and databases.
							I liked it and tried to learn other coding languages on the side, as a way of improving my game.
							But, I didn't have the fundamentals to learn on my own, so after finishing two other bachelor degrees I began the study of "Game Technology and Simulations" at HINN Hamar.
							The thought of coding had grown on me and at HINN I was finally able to crack the code of coding.
							In the first semester we learned all the C++ fundamentals, later to be used in "Unreal Engine".
							In my free time I started learning C# for "Unity Engine" and found that this was a match made in heaven.
							I started making projects and have not looked back since.
						</p>
						<p>
							I used the last year in the game dev school making a game for my bachelor project.
							<a href="https://mathias-kapelrud.itch.io/aridea-the-forgotten-desert">"Aridea: The Forgotten Desert"</a> was an ambitious project where I was the only programmer in a team of two.
							During the production period I drasticly improved my knowledge in both C# and "Unity Engine", giving me the confidence that I can learn whatever I put my mind into.
							The game won both "Best UI" and "Best Gameplay" at the schools' annual reward show, giving me the confidence that what I create is of quality.
						</p>

							<p style="margin: -5px;">Aridea: The Forgotten Desert</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							As of now, I have finished my bachelor project and use this competence to further expand my knowledge of coding.
							As I have learned the fundementals, I am now equipped to master new coding languages.
							It's only a matter of which direction to move.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my free time, I'm now using my coding experience to make life easier and lift the quality of my other activities.
							One of my hobbies is making tabletop games, and through coding I have made apps to easly setup and print prototype cards, thereby streamlining this process to save development time.
							For social gatherings I have made programs to assign "Bingo Boards" and "Secret Santas" to reduce the preparation time.
							I have many more plans for future apps and programs and am filled with joy for all the possibilities that learning programming have opened up for me.
